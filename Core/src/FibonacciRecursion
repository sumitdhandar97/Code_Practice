ðŸ“˜ What does this mean?
Itâ€™s a list of Fibonacci numbers:
n is the position in the sequence.
F(n) is the value of the Fibonacci number at that position.

ðŸ§  How does the formula work?
For any n > 1:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

It means:
To get the value at position n, add the values at position n-1 and n-2.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
Letâ€™s calculate F(5) manually:

F(5) = F(4) + F(3)
     = (F(3) + F(2)) + (F(2) + F(1))
     = ((F(2) + F(1)) + F(1)) + ((F(1) + F(0)) + 1)
     = ...
So it's breaking each value down until it hits base cases:
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

Then it adds those up like a tree structure (recursive calls).

ðŸª´ Think of it like a growing tree:

           F(5)
         /     \
      F(4)     F(3)
     /   \     /  \
   F(3) F(2) F(2) F(1)
  ... (keeps breaking down)
Once it hits base cases (F(1) or F(0)), it stops and starts returning values up the call stack.

ðŸ§® Visual Table (With Values):

n:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
F(n):0   1   1   2   3   5   8
To get:

F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1

F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2

F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3

F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 3 + 2 = 5

âœ¨ Summary:
Concept	Meaning
F(0) = 0	Base case (starting value)
F(1) = 1	Base case
F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2)	Recursive rule for next number


ðŸ§  Formula Recap:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)  // for n > 1
This means:
Every number is the sum of the two numbers before it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
âœ… Goal:
Calculate F(5) using recursion, manually.

ðŸ“Œ Step-by-step Expansion:
We start with:

F(5) = F(4) + F(3)
ðŸ‘‰ Now expand F(4):

F(4) = F(3) + F(2)
So,
F(5) = (F(3) + F(2)) + F(3)
ðŸ‘‰ Now expand F(3):

F(3) = F(2) + F(1)
F(2) = F(1) + F(0)
Letâ€™s expand both branches:

F(5) = (F(3) + F(2)) + F(3)
     = ((F(2) + F(1)) + F(2)) + (F(2) + F(1))
Now expand F(2) into F(1) + F(0) wherever needed.

Letâ€™s plug in everything:

F(5)
= ((F(1) + F(0)) + F(1))   // F(3)
  + ((F(1) + F(0)) + F(1)) // F(3) again
Now we reach base cases:

F(1) = 1

F(0) = 0

ðŸ”¢ Final Values:
Plug in values:


F(5)
= ((1 + 0) + 1) + ((1 + 0) + 1)
= (1 + 1) + (1 + 1)
= 2 + 2
= 5
âœ… So F(5) = 5

ðŸŒ³ Visual Recursion Tree:

          F(5)
         /    \
      F(4)     F(3)
     /   \     /   \
   F(3)  F(2) F(2) F(1)
  / \    / \  / \
F(2)F(1)F(1)F(0)F(1)F(0)
 / \
F(1)F(0)
All base cases (F(0) and F(1)) return numbers directly, and the higher ones sum their results recursively.
